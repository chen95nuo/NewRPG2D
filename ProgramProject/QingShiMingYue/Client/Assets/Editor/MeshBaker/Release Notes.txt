======================
Version 3.3

- Fixed a bug where list of objects to combine produced null pointer exception
- Added BatchPrefabBaker
- Generated normal maps (when no normal on source) are now neutral normal color

======================
Version 3.2.1

- Fixed bug where creating source to combined mapping for multiple materials would add source mat multiple times
- Added several examples and explantions with other Examples 
- Optimization where uvs are not adjusted if there is only one texture in the atlas

======================
Version 3.2

- Fix error creating new bakers
- Fix error baking into prefab if have not baked scene object first.


======================
Version 3.1

- Hides debug statment in multi-mesh-combiner
- Sets default size of texture combiner to 2048
- Removes references to legacy scripts in MB2_UpdateSkinnedMesh scripts.

======================
Version 3.0

- Big refactor to simplify code.
- Cleaned up API 
- removed a number of unecessary parameters from function calls
- Made method names more consistant
- More code is shared between MeshBakerCommon and subclasses
- Mesh combiners inherit from a proper superclass
- Handles objects with negative scale
- MeshCombiner now handles creation and storing of ResultSceneObject

======================
Version 2.11.8

- Fixed bug with BuildSceneObject so it sets the targetRenderer in the MB2_MeshCombiner
- Enforces expected structure of CombinedMesh scene object
- Warning when using Unity's texture packer
- better interface for AddDeleteGameObjectsByIDs

======================
Version 2.11.7

- Fixed bug with generating UV2 for multi mesh baker

======================
Version 2.11.6

- Fixed bug where meshes could not be combined if the original meshes had been deleted from the scene
- Added warning if skinned mesh has been optimized.

======================
Version 2.11.5

- Fixed bug where combining skinned meshes did not work correctly
- Fixed bug with validation which required resultMaterial to be set when doing multi material

======================
Version 2.11.4

- Improved update so developer has control over which channels are updated.

======================
Version 2.11.3

- Fixed problem copying normal maps to atlases.

======================
Version 2.11.2

- Better calculation of ideal atlas size.

======================
Version 2.11.1

- Fixes error displaying suggested treatment for overlapping submeshes

======================
Version 2.11

- Removed/fixed lines of code that generated warnings
- Add feature that suggests what can be done if meshes don't bake
- If only one texture in an atlas then original textures are re-used
- Refactored much of the texture combining code

======================
Version 2.10

- Changed the internal representation to store instanceIDs instead of GameObjects
 this makes it possible to remove destroyed objects as long as the ID instance ID is remembered.
- Added a flag to make validation optional.
- Improved UpdateApproximateBounds and added two scripts that can be do this
- Improved the logging class
- Fixes errors when switching the output after a bake
- Added a version field so dependent projects know the version

======================
Version 2.9.1

Fixes a minor issue where a warning is displayed when skinned meshes
contain no meshes.

======================
Version 2.9

Moved all UnityEditor class usage to classes in the Editor folder
To do this an interface MB2_EditorMethodsInterface and class MB2_EditorMethods were created.
Created new Logging class for better debug tracing
There were a number of changes to the API

MB2_MeshCombiner.Apply takes a delegate function for Generating UV2. This should be null when called at runtime and set to Unwrapping.GenerateUV2 when called from the editor.


These methods require an instance of MB2_EditorMethods when called from the editor. The parameter should be null or ommitted when called at runtime.
	doCombinedValidate
	CreateAndSaveAtlases

These methods were moved to MB2_EditorMethods
	SaveMeshsToAssetDatabase 
	RebuildPrefab

======================
Version 2.8.3

Fixed bug where can only create one result material when creating multiple result materials

Fixed bug when baking all bakers in scene if one has no objects

Cleaned up error message when have not created texture bake results

======================
Version 2.8.2

Added Mesh Baker texture packer

Added button to auto generate source to combined material mappings from objects to combine

Changed texture format messages from warnings to info messages

Fixed null pointer exception when baking assets in place

cleaned up code in TextureCombiner

Added Show/Hide to the API which just updates triangles
