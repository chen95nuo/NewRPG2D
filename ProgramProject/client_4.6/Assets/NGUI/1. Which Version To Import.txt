First of all, before importing either of the packages, always follow the first
two steps of the upgrade process:

1. Start a new scene.
2. Delete the Examples, Resources, and Scripts folders within the NGUI folder.

(of course if you're brand-new to NGUI, the above does not apply to you)

-----------------------------------------------
WHICH VERSION OF THE PACKAGE SHOULD YOU IMPORT?
-----------------------------------------------

1. If you are starting a new project, import the "NGUI v.3.0.4" unity package.
   This video should be a good starting point for you:

2. If you are working with an existing project that was using NGUI 2.7.0 or
   earlier, but don't mind spending some time upgrading it to use the latest
   version's features, import the "NGUI v.3.0.4" unity package as well,
   but ONLY AFTER BACKING UP YOUR CURRENT PROJECT!! This version will have
   all the latest features and fixes, but it is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE
   due to the sheer amount of stuff changed/added in NGUI 3.

   **** !!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!! ****

   This video should help you upgrade:

   There are also some upgrade notes available below the version notes:

   Importing the "Upgrade Tools" unity package will also help you migrate.
   It re-adds the obsolete classes that have been removed, but also adds
   a menu option to automatically find them and upgrade them as needed.
   Note that this only upgrades all objects currently present in the scene,
   and it will NOT upgrade any prefabs you may have. You need to drag them
   into the scene first (and don't forget to hit apply / save later!).

3. If you are in the middle of a project using NGUI 2.6 or earlier, and don't
   have the necessary time to spend upgrading to the latest, import "NGUI 2.7.0"
   unity package. This version will not have the latest features, but it
   will remain backwards compatible with all the previous versions of NGUI,
   letting you keep working with what you have until you have more time.
